# Change Counter
Write me a python **function** that takes in four inputs:
- How many quarters
- How many dimes
- How many nickels
- How many pennies

In between each input, output the number given in asterisks.

And output the total **in cents**. So for example:
```
How many quarters? 4
****
How many dimes? 5
*****
How many nickels? 10
**********
How many pennies? 100
********** (one hundred of these)
Your total is: 300 cents
```
Steps:
- Create the `python` file using the `terminal`
- Open it in `atom` using the `terminal`
- Do the thing
- Run it using the `terminal`


We'll expand on this to do things like:
- Prompt the user repeatedly until you say "quit"
- Convert cents to dollars + cents

Ask questions :)
